/*  Bank account class
    Create a class simulating a bank account
    It hold the following data:
    - Account holder name
    - Bank balance (float)

    You define the name and a starting balance when
    creating the object

    You can only interact in the following way:
    - Make deposits
    - Make withdrawals
    - See the balance
    - See the account holder name

    Think about:
    - internal variables needed
    - what the constructor needs
    - public functions (methods) needed
